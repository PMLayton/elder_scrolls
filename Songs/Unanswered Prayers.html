                <p class="v1">Just the other night a hometown football game
                    My wife and I ran into my old high school flame
                    And as I introduced them the past came back to me
                    And I couldn't help but think of the way things used to be</p>

                <p class="v2">She was the one that I'd wanted for all times
                    And each night I'd spend prayin' that God would make her mine
                    And if he'd only grant me this wish I wished back then
                    I'd never ask for anything again
                    
                <p class="v3">Sometimes I thank God for unanswered prayers
                    Remember when you're talkin' to the man upstairs
                    That just because he doesn't answer doesn't mean he don't care
                    Some of God's greatest gifts are unanswered prayers
                    
                <p class="v4">She wasn't quite the angel that I remembered in my dreams
                    And I could tell that time had changed me
                    Inn her eyes too it seemed
                    We tried to talk about the old days
                    There wasn't much we could recall
                    I guess the Lord knows what he's doin' after all
                    
                    <p classAnd as she walked away and I looked at my wife
                    And then and there I thankedd the good Lord
                    For the gifts in my life
                    Sometimes I thank God for unanswered prayers
                    Remember when you're talkin' to the man upstairs
                    That just because he doesn't answer doesn't mean he don't care
                    Some of God's greatest gifts are unanswered prayers
                    Some of God's greatest gifts are all too often unanswered...
                    Some of God's greatest gifts are unanswered prayers</p>
