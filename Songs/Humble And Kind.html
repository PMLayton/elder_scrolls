                <p class="H1">You know there's a lot that goes by the front door<br>
                    Don't forget the keys under the mat<br>
                    Childhood stars shine, always stay humble and kind<br>
                    Go to church 'cause your momma says to<br>
                    Visit grandpa every chance that you can<br>
                    It won't be a waste of time<br>
                    Always stay humble and kind</p>

                <p class="H2">Hold the door say please say thank you<br>
                    Don't steal, don't cheat, and don't lie<br>
                    I know you got moutains to climb but<br>
                    Always stay humble and kind<br>
                    When the dreams you're dreamin' come to you<br>
                    When the work you put in is realized<br>
                    Let yourself feel the pride but<br>
                    Always stay humble and kind</p>
                    
                <p class="H3">Don't expect a free ride from no one<br>
                    Don't hold a grudge or a chip and here's why<br>
                    Bitterness keeps you from flying<br>
                    Always stay humble and kind<br>
                    Know the difference between sleeping with someone<br>
                    And sleeping with someone you love<br>
                    I love you ain't no pick up line so<br>
                    Always stay humble and kind</p>
                    
                <p class="H4">Hold the door say please say thank you<br>
                    Don't steal, don't cheat, and don't lie<br>
                    I know you got moutains to climb but<br>
                    Always stay humble and kind<br>
                    When those dreams you're dreamin' come to you<br>
                    When the work you put in is realized<br>
                    Let yourself feel the pride but<br>
                    Always stay humble and kind</p>
                    
                <p class="H5">When it's hot, eat a root beer, a popsicle<br>
                    Shut off the AC and roll the windows down<br>
                    Let that summer sun shine<br>
                    Always stay humble and kind<br>
                    Don't take for granted the love this life gives you<br>
                    When you get where you're goin'<br>
                    Don't forget turn back around<br>
                    Help the next one in line<br>
